# Bulk Files

With high capacity disks and tools like RAID,ZFS,BTRFS it has become possible to acumulate many terrabytes (sometimes even petabytes of data).

But this presents a problem: How do you organize many terrabytes (somtimes petabytes) of assorted files?

You could sit and tag individual files, but this could take years. Most files already have metadata but it is all in incompatable formats and is not easly searchable.

## What this is

This is a tool to take all this disimilar and incompatable data, and load it into a database for searching.

## What this is not

- A file manager

- A backup tool

- A file taxonomy
